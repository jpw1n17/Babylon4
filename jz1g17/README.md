Describtion of Adzuna Salary Prediction [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/job-salary-prediction)

Aim of this project:
*    Using different method to predict
*    Comprasion

# Step 1: data_cleanning - fixed -> reduce the dimention of input data

fill NaN and transofom strings to integer vector. At the sametime, update location information by mathching LocationTree.

Processed data can be downloaded at link：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1DrLCkmjK4GxdOsHHnDpEZw pin：8nk1

# Step 2: Genreate one-hot vector

transfrom vector to one-hot vector and using Embedding or HashingVectorizer to process data in FullDescription

# Step 3: Train model

try to use data without fulldescription right now, meet overfitting. Perpare to pre-processing salay data first.
